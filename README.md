# Bobby O'Brien

I'm a student at the [University of Oklahoma](https://www.ou.edu/) pursuing a degree in Computer Science.

The majority of my experience is rooted within the realm of game hacking, which is an umbrella term I like to use to 
describe reverse engineering, software development, anti-cheat analysis, and other skillsets I'm interested in.

With that being said, I am not a "black-hat" hacker, and my projects are all intended to be educational 
for both myself and other members in the community and industry that revolves around their respective topics.
